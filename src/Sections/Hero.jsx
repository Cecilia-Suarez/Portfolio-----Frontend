            <p>Welcome to my portfolio!  A couple of years ago, I started venturing into the IT world and it has completely caught me :) I love traveling, playing the piano, listening to music and everything related to web development. I am always looking for new learning and challenges that allow me to grow personally and professionally. I hope you enjoy this portfolio as much as I enjoyed making it!</p>
